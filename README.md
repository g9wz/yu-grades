This is a simple web app for [Yu](https://yu.edu.sa/) students to see their grades, something they can't do on the university portal.

## Serverless Function ðŸ”„

One main serverless function, `grade.ts`, is used to fetch your grades from the university portal. It calls two APIs:

1. **Actor Details API**: This one grabs your details, like the current semester and all the semesters you've taken.
2. **Grades API**: This one pulls your course results for each specified semester.

They can't be called directly from the client side, hence the use of a serverless function to handle the requests.

> Thereâ€™s mock data in dev mode if you want to play around locally.

## Disclaimer ðŸš¨

The APIs used are built and maintained by the university and require basic student authentication (so, yes, we're allowed to use them - I guess?). If the university wants this taken down, just let me know :)
